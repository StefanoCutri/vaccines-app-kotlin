To use the Vaccine Viewer App, you can download the source code and build the app in Android Studio. You will need to have the latest version of Kotlin and Android Studio installed.

## Usage
To use the Vaccine Viewer App, simply launch the app on your Android device or emulator. You will see a list of vaccines with their corresponding images. You can scroll through the list and click on any item to display a toast message with the vaccine name.
